Packages:
=========

Tested with:

CherryPy 3.1.2
Genshi 0.5.1
MySQLdb 1.2.2

Newer versions are likely to work and older versions may work.  But these are
the versions I used.

Apache:
=======

If you connect this to Apache through mod_python:
You must make sure that www-data can access the config.xml file for
MythTV.  I did this as a hack by copying /etc/mythtv/config.xml to
/var/www/.mythtv/config.xml.
