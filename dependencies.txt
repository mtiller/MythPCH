Packages:
=========

Tested with:

CherryPy 3.1.2
Genshi 0.5.1
MySQLdb 1.2.2

The delete functionality requires the MythTV package that comes with
MythTV 0.22 but it also required a simple patch to the Python bindings
to fix a minor typo (which was reported to the maintainer).  The issue
is with line 968 of MythTV.py.  If the line reads:

    string += BACKEND_SEP + locale.format("%0.6f" % self.stars)

...it should be changed to:

    string += BACKEND_SEP + locale.format("%0.6f", self.stars)

Newer versions of these packages are likely to work and older versions
may work.  But these are the versions I used.

Apache:
=======

If you connect this to Apache through mod_python:
You must make sure that www-data can access the config.xml file for
MythTV.  I did this as a hack by copying /etc/mythtv/config.xml to
/var/www/.mythtv/config.xml.
